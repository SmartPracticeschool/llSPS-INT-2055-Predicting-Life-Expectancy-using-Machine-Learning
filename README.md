Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

Project Summary :

A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. The idea is to develop a Web Application that will predict Life Expectancy Rate of a Country given various features.

Life Expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live. Life Expectancy depends on various factors: Regional Variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illness, Physical Illness, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict the average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.


Assumptions :
 
 1.There is no other illness present other than mentioned in the Project. If anyone is suffering from any other disease then this project will not give results in accordance with other diseases but give results only for those illnesses present in the project.
 
 2.This Project will show results according to the dataset. It can show some wrong statistics in some extreme conditions.
